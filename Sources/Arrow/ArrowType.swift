  /// Timestamps with a non-empty timezone
  /// ------------------------------------
  ///
  /// If a Timestamp column has a non-empty timezone value, its epoch is
  /// 1970-01-01 00:00:00 (January 1st 1970, midnight) in the *UTC* timezone
  /// (the Unix epoch), regardless of the Timestamp's own timezone.
  ///
  /// Therefore, timestamp values with a non-empty timezone correspond to
  /// physical points in time together with some additional information about
  /// how the data was obtained and/or how to display it (the timezone).
  ///
  ///   For example, the timestamp value 0 with the timezone string "Europe/Paris"
  ///   corresponds to "January 1st 1970, 00h00" in the UTC timezone, but the
  ///   application may prefer to display it as "January 1st 1970, 01h00" in
  ///   the Europe/Paris timezone (which is the same physical point in time).
  ///
  /// One consequence is that timestamp values with a non-empty timezone
  /// can be compared and ordered directly, since they all share the same
  /// well-known point of reference (the Unix epoch).
  ///
  /// # Timestamps with an unset / empty timezone
  ///
  /// If a Timestamp column has no timezone value, its epoch is
  /// 1970-01-01 00:00:00 (January 1st 1970, midnight) in an *unknown* timezone.
  ///
  /// Therefore, timestamp values without a timezone cannot be meaningfully
  /// interpreted as physical points in time, but only as calendar / clock
  /// indications ("wall clock time") in an unspecified timezone.
  ///
  ///   For example, the timestamp value 0 with an empty timezone string
  ///   corresponds to "January 1st 1970, 00h00" in an unknown timezone: there
  ///   is not enough information to interpret it as a well-defined physical
  ///   point in time.
  ///
  /// One consequence is that timestamp values without a timezone cannot
  /// be reliably compared or ordered, since they may have different points of
  /// reference.  In particular, it is *not* possible to interpret an unset
  /// or empty timezone as the same as "UTC".
  ///
  /// Conversion between timezones
  ///
  /// If a Timestamp column has a non-empty timezone, changing the timezone
  /// to a different non-empty value is a metadata-only operation:
  /// the timestamp values need not change as their point of reference remains
  /// the same (the Unix epoch).
  ///
  /// However, if a Timestamp column has no timezone value, changing it to a
  /// non-empty value requires to think about the desired semantics.
  /// One possibility is to assume that the original timestamp values are
  /// relative to the epoch of the timezone being set; timestamp values should
  /// then adjusted to the Unix epoch (for example, changing the timezone from
  /// empty to "Europe/Paris" would require converting the timestamp values
  /// from "Europe/Paris" to "UTC", which seems counter-intuitive but is
  /// nevertheless correct).

  /// # Valid Ranges
  ///
  /// According to the Arrow specification ([Schema.fbs]), values of Date64
  /// are treated as the number of *days*, in milliseconds, since the UNIX
  /// epoch. Therefore, values of this type  must be evenly divisible by
  /// `86_400_000`, the number of milliseconds in a standard day.
  ///
  /// It is not valid to store milliseconds that do not represent an exact
  /// day. The reason for this restriction is compatibility with other
  /// language's native libraries (specifically Java), which historically
  /// lacked a dedicated date type and only supported timestamps.
  ///
  /// # Validation
  ///
  /// This library does not validate or enforce that Date64 values are evenly
  /// divisible by `86_400_000`  for performance and usability reasons. Date64
  /// values are treated similarly to `Timestamp(TimeUnit::Millisecond,
  /// None)`: values will be displayed with a time of day if the value does
  /// not represent an exact day, and arithmetic will be done at the
  /// millisecond granularity.
