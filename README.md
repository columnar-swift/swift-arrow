# Swift Arrow

A Swift implementation of Apache Arrow, the cross-language development 
platform for in-memory analytics.

This is an independent Swift-focused project maintained by the Swift 
community. It implements the Apache Arrow specification and is fully 
compatible with other Arrow implementations.

**Why separate from Apache Arrow?**
- Apache's CI infrastructure for Swift is unmaintained (setup-swift)
- Enables Swift-native development practices and tooling
- Faster iteration on Swift-specific issues
- Active Swift maintainers

## Relationship to Apache Arrow
This project is based on Apache Arrow and maintains specification 
compatibility. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
