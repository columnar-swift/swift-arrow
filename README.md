# Swift Arrow

A Swift implementation of Apache Arrow, the cross-language development 
platform for in-memory analytics.

This is an independent Swift-focused project maintained by the Swift 
community. It implements the Apache Arrow specification and is fully 
compatible with other Arrow implementations.

## Why not develop under the Apache Software Foundation

Good project governance requires maintainers with knowledge of Swift and the
Swift community. Currently there are no active ASF maintaners with knowledge of 
Swift. Apache's CI infrastructure for Swift is unmaintained, leading to constant
CI failures. Moving to a Swift-focused organisation allows decisions to be made
more quickly, according to the requirements of the Swift community.

## Relationship to Apache Arrow
This project is based on Apache Arrow-Swift and maintains specification 
compatibility. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
