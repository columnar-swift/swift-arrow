# Swift Arrow

A Swift implementation of Apache Arrow, the cross-language development 
platform for in-memory analytics.

This is an independent Swift-focused project maintained by the Swift 
community. It implements the Apache Arrow specification and is fully 
compatible with other Arrow implementations.

## Relationship to Apache Arrow
This project is based on Apache Arrow-Swift and maintains specification compatibility. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

The decision was made to operate independently of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Good project governance requires maintainers with knowledge of Swift and the Swift community. Currently there are no active ASF maintaners with knowledge of Swift. Apache's CI infrastructure for Swift is unmaintained, leading to intermittent CI failures. Moving to a Swift-focused organisation allows decisions to be made according to the requirements of the Swift community.
